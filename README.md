OneDungeon
==========

A procedural text-based rogue-like written in C#

One Dungeon is a project I wrote about 6 months ago. It focuses heavilly on procedural generation. The maps, characters, armours, weapons and items are procedurally generated using modifiers. The game also generates a score based on killcount and coins looted.
Progression is slow and the game is somewhat enjoyable. The fighting engine is really basic and the AI not that good. This was still an interesting project to write, and I like seeing the different characters it spits out...
The Objects.cs and Mods.cs files contain all the base objects and mods. I encourage those interested to tweak and add new objects/mods to these files...

I might come back to this in the future and add more depth...
